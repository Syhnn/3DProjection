# 3D Projection Adventure
  
A long time ago my math teacher made us do just that in Python. Suddently I felt like redoing it in C++.  
I might redo all of this using another personnal project that isn't on GitHub yet so maybe that repo will soon get deleted. 
In the meantime I'll put this here and we shall this where we end up going with it. 
The plan is make some kind of objects in 3D using a bunch of vertices, and use projection to display them on a 2D screen.
